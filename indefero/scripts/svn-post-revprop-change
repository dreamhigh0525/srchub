# This hook does only one thing:
#
# 1. It calls the svnpostrevpropchange.php script with the current repository
#    and revision as argument. The svnpostrevpropchange.php script will then 
#    trigger the 'svnpostrevpropchange.php::run' event with the repository 
#    path, revision, username, property name and action as arguments together
#    with merged $_ENV and $_SERVER array.
#
# This hook is normally installed automatically at the creation of your
# repository if you have everything configured correctly. If you want
# to enable it later, you need to symlink it as "post-revprop-change" in your 
# $REPOSITORY/hooks folder. It needs to be executable.

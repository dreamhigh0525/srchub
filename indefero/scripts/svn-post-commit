# This hook does only one thing:
#
# 1. It calls the svnpostcommit.php script with the current repository
#    and revision as argument. The svnpostcommit.php script will then 
#    trigger the 'svnpostcommit.php::run' event with the repository path
#    and revision as arguments together with merged $_ENV and $_SERVER 
#    array.
#
# This hook is normally installed automatically at the creation of your
# repository if you have everything configured correctly. If you want
# to enable it later, you need to symlink it as "post-commit" in your 
# $REPOSITORY/hooks folder.
